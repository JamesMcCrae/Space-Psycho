Space-Psycho
============

Space Psycho was a minor QBasic sensation back in the early days of the internet.
Basically I'm posting this source code as a tribute to Hacksoft. Which I assume
is some solo programmer that decided to write some code one day. This source
code is avaiable at various places on the web, but I want to immortalize it on
github. I didn't write this code. I don't know who exactly Hacksoft is. The
credits say some dude named Smack Johnson, this is probably an alias. They also
say they were originally on the web at

this link is long dead, and has been ever since I got the internet.

A large part of the reason I'm posting this code is that it was a major
influence in me becomming a professional video game developer today.

Some thoughts I have on this code is that it is really bad. The game loop works
but it's not very smooth. Partly this was due to the limits of QBasic, partly
it is due to the fact that the authors just didn't know much about programming.
One of my early graphics engines was based on this code. The stuff I'm working
on now is not based off this code at all.

I kind of wonder whatever happened to the guy that programmed this. I'd like to
know what he's doing today. I'd like to meet him. I mean, seriously, he's got to
know that his game is still out there on the internet. I wonder if he ever
became a real game programmer. I did, and in part thanks to him.

On another note. I'm giving away the ending of the game here, but Arnold
Schwarzenegger is the President of the United States in the game. Interestingly
enough, Schwarzenegger did go on to be the governor of California. So the
programmer of this game must have known that Arnold was into politics. Very
interesting.
